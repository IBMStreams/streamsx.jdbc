    <info:description>
    
  The **streamsx.jdbc** toolkit uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API for accessing relational databases.

  It supports all databases that provide a JDBC drive in a JAR library.

  The streamsx.jdbc toolkit has been tested with following databases:

  **IBM Db2, ORACLE, Teradata, PostgresSql, Microsoft SQL Server, MySql**.

  The JDBCRun operator is the main operator in the streamsx.jdbc toolkit. It runs a user-defined SQL statement that is based on an input tuple.
   
  The statement is run once for each input tuple received. Result sets that are produced by the statement are emitted as output stream tuples. 
    
  The **JDBCRun** operator is commonly used to update, merge, and delete database management system (DBMS) records. 
  
  This operator is also used to retrieve records, create and drop tables, and to call stored procedures. 
  
  it is strongly recommended before you begin with the implementation of a SPL application on JDBCRun operator, read the **documentation of database vendors**.
  
  Every database vendor delivers one or more JAR libraries as jdbc driver. Please check the version of your database server and the version of JDBC driver libraries.
	  

  Behavior in a consistent region:
  
  The **JDBCRun** operator can be used in a consistent region. 
  
  It cannot be the start operator of a consistent region. In a consistent region, the configured value of the transactionSize is ignored. Instead, database commits are performed (when supported by the DBMS) on consistent region checkpoints, and database rollbacks are performed on consistent region resets.
  
  On **drain**: If there are any pending statements, they are run. If the statement generates a result set and the operator has an output port, tuples are generated from the results and submitted to the output port. If the operator has an error output port and the statement generates any errors, tuples are generated from the errors and submitted to the error output port.
  
  On **checkpoint**: A database commit is performed.
  
  On **reset**: Any pending statements are discarded. A rollback is performed.

  The JDBCRun operator support **optional type** feature.

  It supports also **phoenix jdbc** to connect to the HBASE database.
  
  The **JDBCRun** operator has been improved in version 1.4.0 with a new parameter **checkConnection**. This optional parameter specifies whether a **checkConnection** thread should be start. It checks periodically the status of JDBC connection. The JDBCRun sends in case of any failure a SqlCode and a message to SPL application.
 
  ++ What is new:
  
  ++ What is new in version 1.4.3

  * The JDBCRun operators provides a new parameter **credentials**. 
    This optional parameter specifies a JSON string that contains the JDBC credentials.
    The JDBC credentials string must contain valid JSON format and a set of name/value pairs for
    **username**, **password** and **jdbcurl**. 

  * support **Streams application configuration** 
 
 
  ++ What is new in version 1.4.4
  
 * Insert BLOB bug fixed #82
  
 ++ What is new in version 1.5.0
   
 * Add **jdbcUrl** to the jdbc properties.
 * Supports both **jdbcUrl** and **jdbcurl** in credentials and in properties file.
 * Now it is poosible to connect to a database with the following parameters:
  
 * 1- **jdbcUser**, **JdbcPassword**, and **jdbcUrl**.
 * 2- **jdbcProperties**: specifies the path name of the file that contains **user**, **password**, **jdbcUrl**.
 It supports also 'username' or 'jdbcUser' as 'user' and 'jdbcPassword' as 'password' and 'jdbcurl' as 'jdbcUrl'.
 * 3- **jdbcCredentials**: A JSON string that cotains **username**, **password**, **jdbcUrl**(jdcburl)
 * 4- **appConfigName**: Streams application configuration that defines **username**, **password**, **jdbcUrl**(jdcburl)

 ++ What is new in version 1.6.0
   
 * The JDBCRun operators provides new parameters for SSL configuration:  **keyStoreType**, **trustStoreType**, **securityMechanism**, **pluginName**.

 ++ What is new in version 1.7.0

 * The JDBCRun operator provides a new parameter **idleSessionTimeOut**. Once the idle time value is reached, it close the database connection .
 
 * Supports two new application configuration properties:  **keyStorePassword** and **trustStorePassword**

++ What is new in version 1.7.1

The idle session timer issue fixed. 

++ What is new in version 1.7.2
 * New error messages for globalization.

++ What is new in version 1.8.0
 * Add property **retrieveMessagesFromServerOnGetMessage=true** to the Db2 URL to retrieve full SQL error message.
 
++ What is new in version 1.9.0
 * New parameters commitOnPunct and batchOnPunct.
 * Metrics introduced: nFailures, nCommits (commitOnPunct==true), nBatches (batchOnPunct==true)
